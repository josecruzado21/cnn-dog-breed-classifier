This model was first proposed in 2001 by Viola and Jones in their [research paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) \"Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple features\". This is a very efficient and highly accurate algorithm, extensively used even in the current deep learning era.\n",

    "In simple, the algorithm uses what is known as Haar features to detect attributes in the image. These features have a similar structure to kernel matrices on CNN, with the difference that the values inside the matrix are assigned a priori (not estimated) and take the values between 0 (white) and 1 (black).\n",
